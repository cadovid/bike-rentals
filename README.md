# Predicting Bike Rentals

In this project the following models are developed:

  - Linear Regression Model
  - Decision Tree Model
  - Random Forest Model

The objective is to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. For this, we will use the data from a communal bike sharing station located in Washington D.C., US.
